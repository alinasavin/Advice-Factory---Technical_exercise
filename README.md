# Advice Factory

## About the project

After an amazing first chat with Amigo I was given the task to create a random quote inspirational quote generator that allows the user to view random quotes and add new quotes.

## Overview

The advice app allows the user to generate random pieces of advice with the touch of the button. The user can also type in his own advice that gets saved into the firebase database where can be edited in realtime. As a bonus the app give some extra funny quotes to lighten the user's mood, all stored locally in the app.

### Built with

## What I have learned

This was a great opportunity for me to refresh my React skills and the use of React hooks. It was also a challenge as I have not worked before with Firebase Realtime database. I have read up on the resources available and overcame some obstacles with the new version of firebase used, but all worked in the end.

## Future goals

Learn and build this using MondoDb or another data database program.
